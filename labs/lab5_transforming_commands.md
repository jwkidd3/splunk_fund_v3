# Lab 5: Transforming Commands in Splunk
*Day 2 - Lab 1 of 5*

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you will master Splunk's transforming commands to derive meaningful statistics and insights from your data. You'll work with real-world scenarios involving web application logs, database audit trails, and system logs to understand how transforming commands can help answer business questions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Use the `top` command to identify most frequent values
- Apply the `rare` command to find uncommon events  
- Leverage the `stats` command with various statistical functions
- Create reports with count, distinct count, sum, and average calculations
- Rename fields and format output for better readability
- Sort and limit results for focused analysis
- Combine multiple transforming commands in a search pipeline

---

## ðŸš€ Welcome to Day 2!

Today you'll learn advanced Splunk analysis and reporting techniques. You'll build on the fundamental search skills from Day 1 to create statistical reports, dashboards, and automated monitoring.

---

## Prerequisites

- Completed Labs 1-4 (Day 1)
- Basic understanding of Splunk search syntax
- Familiarity with field extraction and filtering

## Lab Environment Setup

### Step 1: Verify Sample Data

Before starting, ensure you have the required sample data loaded:

```spl
index=main earliest=-30d latest=now
| stats count by sourcetype
```

You should see these sourcetypes:
- `access_combined_wcookie` - Web application logs
- `db_audit` - Database audit logs  
- `linux_secure` - Linux security logs

If data is missing, return to Lab 1 to load the sample data.

### Step 2: Set Search Time Range

For all exercises in this lab:
1. Navigate to **Search & Reporting**
2. Set time range to **All time**
3. Ensure you're searching in the `main` index

> **Note**: Searching "All time" is not a production best practice but necessary for our limited dataset.

## Key Concepts

### Transforming Commands Overview

Transforming commands take search results and transform them into statistical data tables. Key commands include:

- **top/rare**: Find most/least common values
- **stats**: Calculate statistics (count, sum, avg, etc.)
- **chart**: Create data series for visualization
- **timechart**: Create time-based data series
- **transaction**: Group related events

### Field Reference

Throughout this lab, you'll work with these key fields:

| Sourcetype | Key Fields |
|------------|------------|
| access_combined_wcookie | action, bytes, categoryId, clientip, itemId, JSESSIONID, productId, referer, status, file |
| db_audit | Command, Duration, Type |
| linux_secure | COMMAND, PWD, pid, process |

## Exercise 1: Analyzing Best-Selling Products with `top`

**Scenario**: The sales team needs a report of the five best-selling products.

### Task 1.1: Find Successful Purchases

First, identify events where purchases were completed:

```spl
index=main sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie 
  status=200 
  file=success.do
```

**Expected Results**: Events showing successful purchase transactions

### Task 1.2: Get Top Products

Add the `top` command to find best-selling products:

```spl
index=main sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie 
  status=200 
  file=success.do 
| top productId
```

**Validation**: You should see 10 products with counts and percentages

### Task 1.3: Limit Results

Modify to show only top 5 products:

```spl
index=main sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie 
  status=200 
  file=success.do 
| top productId limit=5
```

### Task 1.4: Remove Percentages

Clean up the display:

```spl
index=main sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie 
  status=200 
  file=success.do 
| top productId limit=5 showperc=false
```

## Challenge Exercises

### Challenge 1: Multi-Metric Dashboard

Create a single search that shows:
- Top 5 products sold
- Total revenue (assuming bytes represents price)
- Average transaction size
- Number of unique customers

```spl
index=main sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie 
  status=200 file=success.do 
| stats count as Sales, 
        sum(bytes) as Revenue, 
        avg(bytes) as "Avg Transaction", 
        dc(clientip) as "Unique Customers" by productId 
| sort -Sales 
| head 5
```

### Challenge 2: Time-Based Analysis

Analyze purchase patterns over time:

```spl
index=main sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie 
  status=200 file=success.do 
| bin _time span=1d 
| stats count as Purchases, 
        dc(clientip) as Customers by _time 
| eval "Purchases per Customer"=round(Purchases/Customers,2)
```

### Challenge 3: Correlation Analysis

Find correlation between file access and client location:

```spl
index=main sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie 
| stats count by file, clientip 
| stats list(clientip) as IPs, 
        dc(clientip) as "Unique IPs", 
        sum(count) as "Total Accesses" by file 
| sort -"Unique IPs"
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No results returned | Check time range is set to "All time" |
| Fields not found | Verify field names are case-sensitive |
| Stats showing 0 | Ensure status=200 filter is included |
| Percentages showing when not wanted | Add `showperc=false` to top command |
| Sort not working | Use `-` prefix for descending sort |

### Performance Tips

1. **Use specific indexes**: Always specify `index=main`
2. **Filter early**: Apply filters before transforming commands
3. **Limit time range**: Use smallest time range possible in production
4. **Use field aliases**: Create reusable field aliases for complex extractions

## Cleanup

No cleanup required for this lab as we're only running searches, not creating any persistent objects.
